## [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://mentalhealthintech.streamlit.app/) Mental Health in the Tech Industry Q&A Chatbot (Capstone Project)


The tech industry thrives on innovation and passionate individuals.

However, demanding work environments can contribute to stress, anxiety, and burnout among employees. While data suggests this is a significant issue, current analysis methods lack accessibility and user-friendliness.

To create a more supportive and productive tech landscape, fostering open communication about mental health is essential.  By destigmatizing the topic, we can encourage employees to seek help and build a culture of well-being.

This initiative proposes a web-based tool that transforms mental health data into clear and engaging insights. This empowers both tech professionals and the public to understand the scope of the issue and its impact on the workforce.

With increased awareness and accessible data through the use of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot in this case, we can identify trends, develop targeted solutions, and ultimately build awarenes towards healthier workplaces in the tech industry for all.


## Quickstart

### Setup Python environment

The Python version used when this was developed was 3.10.14


```bash
python -mvenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you run into issues related to hnswlib or chroma-hnswlib while installing requirements you may need to install system package for the underlying package.

For example, on Ubuntu 22.04 this was needed before pip install of hnswlib would succeed.

```bash
sudo apt install python3-hnswlib
```

### Setup .env file with API tokens needed.

```
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN="<Put your token here>"
```

### Setup Streamlit app secrets.

#### 1. Set up the .streamlit directory and secrets file.

```bash
mkdir .streamlit
touch .streamlit/secrets.toml
chmod 0600 .streamlit/secrets.toml
```

#### 2. Edit secrets.toml

**Either edit `secrets.toml` in you favorite editor.**

```toml
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN="<Put your token here>"
```

**Or, you can just reuse .env contents from above.**

```bash
cat < .env >> .streamlit/secrets.toml
```

### Verify Environment

1. Check that LangChain dependencies are working.

```bash
python basic_chain.py
```

2. Check that Streamlit and dependencies are working.

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
